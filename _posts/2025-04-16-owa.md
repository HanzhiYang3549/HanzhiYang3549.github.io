# Introduction

Owa Playground is a vibrant play space designed for children thriving in challenging environments. Inspired by the lime orange tree in both its color palette and structural forms, this playground - just like the tree that grows sweet and strong after every storm - creates a space where children can heal, grow, and rediscover joy no matter what they've been through. 
This playground uses minimal materials and recycled objects to create maximum emotional and physical impact, offering children a space that feels both open and magical. Its unique structure allows body-driven interactions, such as climbing, swaying, balancing, or hiding. 
The structure embraces repeated, modular units that are easy to manufacture, stack, and assemble. It supports both visual interest and construction efficiency. By avoiding dependence on high-precision tools or specialized hardware, the design remains practical and buildable even in under-resourced environments like refugee camps. This is a playful system designed for real-world conditions.
