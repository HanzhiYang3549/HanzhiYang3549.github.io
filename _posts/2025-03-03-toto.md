# Introduction

ToTo are wooden trivet sets that can protect your desk surfaces. This trivet draws inspiration from the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, playfully merging its iconic "X" and "O" symbols. The interwoven design captures the nostalgic charm of the childhood game while adding a touch of whimsy to your kitchen. The pieces in this set can be stacked together, used separately, or connected to more pieces to support different containers. Combining layers of wood, we made sure this trivet is sturdy enough for you to support your pots or plates without worry. This trivet is offered in three rich wood finishes: deep walnut, warm mahogany, and natural oakâ€”providing a shade for every kitchen palette.
