# Introduction

The Radius is a night lamp crafted primarily from plywood and mahogany veneer. Inspired by the graceful curve of a crescent moon, its arched design casts a circular glow on the wall when illuminated. With a soft, warm light, this night lamp creates a cozy and inviting atmosphere without overwhelming brightness. The built-in sliding rail at the base enables smooth angle adjustment, allowing users to easily position the light for optimal illumination. Every edge of the lamp has been smoothly rounded, creating a safer and more comfortable user experience. This considerate design element not only prevents accidental bumps but also gives the lamp an inviting, organic aesthetic.
