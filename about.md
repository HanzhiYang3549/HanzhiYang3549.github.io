My name is Hanzhi Yang. I am an industrial designer who loves to explore and turn ideas into real products. l am passionate about all kinds of product design, ranging from furniture, toys and consumer products. 

I am a designer from China, currently studying Industrial Design at Emily Carr University of Art + Design in Canada. This academic journey has inspired my strong interest in minimalist and playful design. I am particularly passionate about designing products for children. I hope to bring comfort and healing to people through the interaction between users and the products.

In addition to product design, I have also developed skills in picture book creation, illustration and visual arts. I am eager to integrate these diverse skills into my work to add more creativity and value to my design.
