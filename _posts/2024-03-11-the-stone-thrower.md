# Introduction

The stone thrower is a therapeutic toy specifically designed for children in war-torn areas. The gameplay involves children throwing stones into a container, with the goal of determining who can achieve the most successful throws. This design aims to help children understand the concept of balance during play while enhancing their communication and teamwork skills through group competition. The unique tri-pod structure of the stone thrower gives it excellent adaptability to various terrains, ensuring stability even in complex environments. The pulleys along its edges allow for clear scoring whenever a stone lands in the container.  The vibrant color blocks of the stone thrower not only spark children's creativity but also help them rebuild social skills through team play, allowing them to rediscover lost joy while having fun.
