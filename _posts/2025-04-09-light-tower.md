# Introduction

The light tower is a versatile and adjustable night light, inspired by the stone cairns often built by hikers as trail markers or memorials—and in Tibetan culture, as symbols of blessings.  
This elegant lamp provides 360° soft ambient lighting, with adjustable brightness controlled through its base. Designed for both aesthetics and functionality, it is 3D-printed from lightweight PLA material, while its hollow core ensures proper airflow to prevent overheating. The most distinctive feature of the light tower is its "stones"—each uniquely shaped and sized—that can be freely rearranged or removed. This playful design not only enhances its visual appeal but also adds playfulness to your living space.
